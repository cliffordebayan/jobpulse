The hardest part of my job was having conference calls at 5 am ending the day at another call at 11 pm because of the location. For me it was very stressful but I tried to not show it. Going from United Air Lines (etc) where I worked more on the Continental US to an international company where they have staff everywhere and experts in everything, it was overwhelming. There was no typical day! But everyone at IBM was really nice to work with.

        'I enjoyed working in IBM Singapore as I find it very productive working there and at the end of the day I felt very accomplished as many work has been completed and always eager for the work I will get the next day. The project manager is a very understanding person and have a very strong team spirit which is very good in getting the team going.I was given many opportunities in IBM Singapore for my career advancement. Example: doing Functional consultant tasks .My main achievement working here is that I get to be a techno functional where I write the functional specification, develop ABAP programs, perform testing, performed quality assurance and prepared documentations.

I tjink think the upper management is not aware of this. Imagina 1 month ka na nag aantay pero wala ka parin OPS interview? I already completed all of my assessments and met the required score pero napaka BAGAL talaga ng cognizant for God sake. Some of the posts na nakikita ko J.O na hindi parin talaga inu-update si applicant. Like seriously ?? cognizant is better than this.',

        "Tbh I was very much concerned about this last to last year during my placement. Cognizant was the first big company to come for campus. Cognizant had this program where they train you and you have to give exams and accordingly you get GenC or Gen C Next package. Both are below average. Gen C is lower than what fruit sellers earn in a month. Gen C Next is average. It is like the details you mentioned in your post.\r\n\r\nThey started this same game. Our clg literally threatened us that if you select the Cognizant training programme. If you do not pass or voluntarily decide to quit midway they will blacklist us from further placements. This was the only point which I did not like. I did not want to put all eggs in one basket. A lot of my friends did this stating that they'll give us free training and also give us job. Somehow they were sold on the idea. Not choosing the cts route was a tough deicision but a very right deicision. Later on I got a good company with a higher package. Cts teaches you how to take life decisions more than software development",
