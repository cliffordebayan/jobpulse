We often used the team approach to our customers. Depending on what they wanted, we brought in the right people. The hardest part of my job was having conference calls at 5 am ending the day at another call at 11 pm because of the location. For me it was very stressful but I tried to not show it. Going from United Air Lines (etc) where I worked more on the Continental US to an international company where they have staff everywhere and experts in everything, it was overwhelming. There was no typical day! But everyone at IBM was really nice to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was going to Sydney for a meeting on a customer project and then seeing the city at night!everyone is eager to share their knowledgelong hours and not so nice hotels',

        "Tbh I was very much concerned about this last to last year during my placement. Cognizant was the first big company to come for campus. Cognizant had this program where they train you and you have to give exams and accordingly you get GenC or Gen C Next package. Both are below average. Gen C is lower than what fruit sellers earn in a month. Gen C Next is average. It is like the details you mentioned in your post.\r\n\r\nThey started this same game. Our clg literally threatened us that if you select the Cognizant training programme. If you do not pass or voluntarily decide to quit midway they will blacklist us from further placements. This was the only point which I did not like. I did not want to put all eggs in one basket. A lot of my friends did this stating that they'll give us free training and also give us job. Somehow they were sold on the idea. Not choosing the cts route was a tough deicision but a very right deicision. Later on I got a good company with a higher package. Cts teaches you how to take life decisions more than software development",
